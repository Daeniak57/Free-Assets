### **Old Display Shader**
You want some "realistic" screen display that's works in BIRP or URP?

- URP Version : https://payhip.com/b/0EdFB (This is very old)
> URP Version is old and it was my first shader but it does the job
#### **URP Preview Video:** [Click here to watch the preview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTRJ0C7NWUY))

- BIRP Version : https://payhip.com/b/aSmDA (This is more recent)
> BIRP Version is more recent because it was made for VRChat but it also works anywhere else in BIRP
